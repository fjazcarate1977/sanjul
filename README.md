In order to show how we work, this is the monorepo that includes all our web architecture, frontend and backend, ready to be deployed.

## Arquitecture

- Front End => **NodeJS**
- Back End => **Python**
- Virtualization => **Docker**

## Installation instructions

**NOTE: The monorepo has been designed and developed for an UNIX operating systems (Linux, OSX) you could find some issues triying to use into a windows.**

You need to have installed:
