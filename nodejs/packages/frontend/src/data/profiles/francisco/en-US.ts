Thanks to a **Spectrum ZK 48K**, I started my journey in this world. My first line of code was ***load ""***, 
which was necessary to start loading the game on a cassette, for the joy and delight of my neighbors.<br><br>

After the initial euphoria, I started to **program small things** in it, like a flag, although I mostly used it to play games.
Years went by and that interest disappeared until, in an ***"INEM course"***, I came across **Action Script, Flash, HTML...**<br><br>

From that moment on, I started a career path to where I am right now, as disparate as it is fun.<br><br>

With a markedly **self-taught** profile and a **restless** spirit, I enjoy every project with the challenges that it have.
Both in terms of technology and management, especially **human resources**.<br><br>

Technologically I am **FullStack**, mainly **JavaScript**, but I adapt quickly to other languages like **Python, PHP...**. 
Thanks to my brother Leon I have expanded my knowledge about ***"Big Data"***.<br><br>

You have at your disposal my **repository** with several examples of how I work including the code of this page.
